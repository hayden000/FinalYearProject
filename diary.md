- **11/10/2023**
    - Created PyDoc for the Python functions.

- **19/10/2023**
    - Completed the initial solver for the problem. This is the brute force algorithm.

- **21/10/2023**
    - Started work on the second solver for the problem. This is the bipartite matching problem. Doing prior research
      about how to represent the problem in this format so it can be solved.

- **22/10/2023**
    - Read the documentation for the three packages (pyplot (SciPy), union & networkx) that will be employed in this
      implementation of the solver.

- **23/10/2022**
    - Created the representation of the bipartite graph in Python.

- **24/10/2023**
    - Implemented the union-find algorithm for job groupings.

- **30/10/2023**
    - Completed the second solver (the bipartite graph maximal matching).

- **1/11/2023**
    - Added a write-up about the second solver to the report.

- **3/11/2023**
    - Worked heavily on the report and the algorithms, maths, and theory used. Including classical complexity and the
      code used.

- **6/11/2023**
    - Set the problem up as a SAT problem and researched OR TOOLS for Googleâ€™s SAT solver.

- **7/11/2023**
    - Implemented the SAT solver to solve the WSP problem.

- **8/11/2023**
    - Explain the SAT problem in the report. Showed the code used and explained how the setup worked.

- **9/11/2023**
    - Researched and looked at the documentation for the GUI building software. Created an initial design for the GUI
      based on the inputs and outputs of the problem.

- **11/11/2023**
    - Made all the GUI pages for the initial program.

- **13/11/2023**
    - Working on the report about.

- **15/11/2023**
    - Linked all GUI pages together into a program (however, no functionality has been added at this stage).

- **16/11/2023**
    - Worked on computational experiments for the report about the running times of the solvers.

- **20/11/2023**
    - Worked on report adding sections related to FPT, vertex cover and graph traversal.

- **25/11/2023**
    - Refactoring code to prepare for interim submission.

- **6/12/2023**
    - Produced video for demonstrating code.

- **16/12/2023**
    - Wrote a manual function that checks at most and at least constraints (with a brute force approach).

- **18/11/2023**
    - Breached functions to create an integer linear programming solver.
    - Started implementation of a solver in Gurobi.

- **11/11/2023**
    - Made all the GUI pages for the initial program.

- **26/12/2023**
    - Began producing documentation in pydoc for the code written.

- **6/1/2024**
    - Added sections to the report describing the new code written.
    - Wrote about linear programming techniques in the report.

- **12/1/2024**
    - Worked on making the GUI functional.

- **16/1/2024**
    - Made all the GUI pages for the initial program.
    - Added functions to parse constraints from the user input:
        - This involved ensuing that each type of solver is able to accept all constraints in the same format.

- **28/1/2024**
    - Completed implementation of the GUI.
    - Linked each window to each other to make a full interface.
